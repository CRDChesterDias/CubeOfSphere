#Student Notes

## Files
   - .gitgnore - maybe useful for students to adjust
   - otherwise most students can ignore the other files in this directory.  They are (more or less) specific to 
     the Webstorm IDE.

## Webstorm IDE

If you happen to prefer using the Webstorm IDE you can use the project files in .idea

Further, _optionally_ you might want to:
	- install node.js from the web
	- Then from the command-line:
		$ cd <root directory of the Lighting directory>
		$ npm install

	  This will install extra 'plugins' that the mentioned .idea project files use for enabling 'advanced'
          developer features.  (Again this is optional).

## Other IDEs

Students are free to use whatever IDE that want.  Make sure to git add/commit the proper project files for the IDE 
you are using.  See your IDE documentation to determine which project files should be committed to your project's 
git repo.
